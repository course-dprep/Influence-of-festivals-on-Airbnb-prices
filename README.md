# Influence of festivals in New Orleans on Airbnb prices 
This research proposes to investigate the relationship between festivals taking place and the prices of Airbnb's, in New Orleans. It is hypothesized that whenever a festival is taking place, demand for Airbnb's will increase, and therefore average prices of Airbnb's will increase as well on these days. 

## Research motivation
Airbnb is a company which facilitates as an online marketplace for lodging, homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities. Since Airbnb is an online marketplace, its prices depend highly on the demand for B&Bs. When demand is increasing, so will the prices of Airbnb's. In this research festivals will be taken into account as they can increase the demand for Airbnb's. During festivals the demand for Airbnb's is expected to increase, due to visitors at the festivals that do not live nearby, and therefore need an accommodation to stay during the time of the festival. In order to research the effect of festivals on the Airbnb prices, this project focusses on Airbnbâ€™s in New Orleans and 3 festivals taking place in that area, namely: 

Mardi Gras: 1 march 2022;
French Quarter Festival: 21 april 2022 - 24 april 2022;
New Orleans Jazz Festival: 29 april - 8 may 2022.

## Research Question
What is the effect of festivals taking place in New Orleans on the Airbnb prices?

## Research method

To analyze the price mark-up for Airbnb accommodations during a festival in New Orleans, we will use an ANOVA analysis. The dependent variable is the average price of an Airbnb accommodations per day. And as an independent variable, a dummy variable on whether any of the three festivals is taking place (whereas 0 = no festival taking place and 1 = either one of the 3 festivals is taking place), will be taken into the model.

Data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/new-orleans) will be used over 2022.

##
This is a basic example repository using Gnu make for a reproducible research workflow, as described in detail here: [tilburgsciencehub.com](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/). 

The main aim of this to have a basic structure, which can be easily adjusted to use in an actual project.  In this example project, the following is done: 
1. Download and prepare data
2. Run some analysis
3. Present results in a final pdf generated using LaTeX

### Dependencies
- R 
- R packages: `install.packages("stargazer")`
- [Gnu Make](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/make) 
- [TeX distribution](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/latex/?utm_campaign=referral-short)
- For the `makefile` to work, R, Gnu make and the TeX distribution (specifically `pdflatex`) need to be made available in the system path 
- Detailed installation instructions can be found here: [tilburgsciencehub.com](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/)


### Notes
- `make clean` removes all unncessary temporary files. 
- Tested under Linux Mint (should work in any linux distro, as well as on Windows and Mac) 
- IMPORTANT: In `makefile`, when using `\` to split code into multiple lines, no space should follow `\`. Otherwise Gnu make aborts with error 193. 
- Many possible improvements remain. Comments and contributions are welcome!
